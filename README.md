# Reddit Web Scraper/Poster
You can post, scrape, and read specified inputs that you pass in
Made use of the `PRAW` and `Twilio REST` API

1. To get started, you want to make sure that you have python/python3 install on your computer. 
2. Once you have that installed, you want to go install `PRAW` and `Twilio` by running `pip install praw` and `pip install twilio`.(Make sure you are using pip3 if you are in a python3 envrionment)
3. Head over to reddit and get access to their APIs so you can scrape it with your own account. 
4. Have fun!
